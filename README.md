ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Clay! Not much to see here, but I just wanted to say that...

- I'm a computer science undergraduate.
- Iâ€™m interested in networking, web development, and video game development.
- And Iâ€™m currently learning more about Linux, C++, and OpenGL.

Thanks for reading, and take care.
